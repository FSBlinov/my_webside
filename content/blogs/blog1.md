“Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.” 

Martin Heidegger, “Poetry, Language, Thought” 1971


Bonus!! 

Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 

Jesus, in Gospel of Mathew, 6:34

# **Fedor (like Dostoevsky) Blinov**
 
##### ~~Детство~~
I was born in Moscow, Russia and lived there for my whole life. As a kid I was doing violin and dreaming about becoming a physicist but ended up studying finance (cuz of course I would).

##### ~~Отрочество~~
I graduated from the Higher School of Economics (HSE Moscow) with *Summa Cum Laude* majoring in econ and finance. The program was quite heavy on quantitative things (they made us run parametric GARCHs and stuff .-. ) so I had some exposure to programming, especially in R. Also wrote a thesis on return multifractality, tonns of coding ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ.

##### *Юность [Ongoing]*
Here I am now, at dear LBS hoping for an offer to cling to and not have to go back home!

Things I like (in no particular order):

1. Food (any kind, both eating and cooking)
2. R assigments
3. ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός
4. [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosphy](https://plato.stanford.edu/)
5. Cats and dogs and all sorts of things with tails/feathers/scales/...

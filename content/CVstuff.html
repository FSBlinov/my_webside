<p>I graduated from the Higher School of Economics (HSE Moscow) with <em>Summa Cum Laude</em> majoring in econ and finance. The program was quite heavy on quantitative things (they made us run parametric GARCHs and stuff .-. ) so I had some exposure to programming, especially in R. Also wrote a thesis on return multifractality, tonns of coding ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ.</p>
